One of the important changes included in this new law was to allow 16 and 17 year olds, as well as qualifying foreign citizens, to register and vote in Wales for the first time. This is a big change to our democracy in Wales and to highlight this, we have launched a new campaign called “Welcome to your vote”. Put simply, we want to ensure that these new voters firstly understand that they can now take part in our democratic process and then are clear as to how to do so. The campaign will run until the autumn and will specifically target these new groups through advertising on social media, website and digital radio channels. There will be more work between now and next May’s Senedd elections, including the publication of education resources and a national pre-election campaign, to ensure that voters in Wales, including the newly enfranchised, are aware of their rights and how they can confidently take part in our democracy. Below are useful answers to some questions you may have about this campaign, the franchise changes and registering to vote. Questions What is the Welcome to your vote campaign? Our Welcome to your vote campaign, launched last week, welcomes the newly enfranchised to democracy in Wales. The campaign uses social media channels (Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat), digital display and digital audio advertising, to encourage the newly enfranchised to register to vote. We want to welcome the newly enfranchised to democracy in Wales. We want them to know they are now eligible to vote and to visit www.gov.uk/registertovote to register. Who are the newly enfranchised groups? 16 and 17 year olds and qualifying foreign citizens are now eligible to register and will be able to vote in the Senedd elections in May 2021. 14 and 15 year olds can also register to vote. If they are 16 years old on the day of the election, they will be able to vote. Who is a “qualifying foreign citizen”? A qualifying foreign citizen is a resident in Wales but isn’t a Commonwealth citizen, a citizen of the European Union or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland, and has leave to remain or can be treated as having leave to remain.
